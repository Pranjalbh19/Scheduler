//In development, with hot reloading (like in Next.js, Vite,
//  or other modern dev tools), your files/modules get 
// reloaded frequently. If you create a new Prisma client every time, 
// you'll quickly end up with many database connections, 
// which can crash your app or exceed Neonâ€™s connection limit
